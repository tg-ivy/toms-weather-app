# Weather Dashboard - A Weather Display Web App

## Description

The aim of this project is to allow the user to view weather data on any city they input within the search. Weather data is taken every 3 hours, and displays info on temperature, humidity, and windspeed.

The app utilises local storage to allow the user to see their search history, use it to re-display any data previously shown.
